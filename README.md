OurReceipt

Digital Receipts for a Greener Future

OurReceipt eliminates paper receipts by digitizing transactions through QR-based receipt generation and cloud synchronization. It empowers consumers to track purchases and helps merchants cut costs and carbon emissions ‚Äî all while supporting Singapore‚Äôs Green Plan 2030.

üì± Overview

Every year, millions of paper receipts end up in landfills, contributing to unnecessary waste and CO‚ÇÇ emissions.
OurReceipt replaces these with seamless, secure, and eco-friendly digital alternatives.

The system connects consumer, merchant, and backend modules into one ecosystem:
	‚Ä¢	Consumer App (SwiftUI) ‚Äî Scan receipts, track purchases, visualize spending, and monitor personal carbon savings.
	‚Ä¢	Merchant App (SwiftUI) ‚Äî Generate receipts via QR codes, track transaction logs, and manage sales analytics.
	‚Ä¢	Backend (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL) ‚Äî Handles receipt generation, storage, user authentication, and carbon-footprint analytics.
